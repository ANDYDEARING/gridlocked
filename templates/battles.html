    <h1>Battles</h1>
    <p>Here the player manages their current battles. Battles are not timed and are paused by default, encouraging players to play here and there when they have time.</p>
    <h2>PvE</h2>
    <p>In a typical PvE battle, the player faces procedurally generated "Freelancers."</p>
    <p>Freelancers can be captured by GridLocking them: surrounding them on all 4 sides and keeping the surrounding mechs operational for a full turn cycle. In practice, this is best done by destroying the remaining mechs and targeting the lone survivor for capture and ultimate recruitment.</p>
    <p>Other than recruitment, players can find randomly generated equipment.</p>
    <h2>PvP</h2>
    <p>In a typical PvP battle, players take turns and are alerted via notification when it is their turn.</p>
    <p>PvP battles can either be Locked (where mechs are level balanced) or Open (where they carry their native stats).</p>
    <p>Ranked Battles will involve constructing teams in the workshop from a pool of mechs and equipment identical for all other players.</p>
    <p>Junkyard is also available with a common mech and equipment pool drafted by both players.</p>
    <p>Rewards will vary based on the format, but could include xp, fixed rewards, or keeping drafted mechs or equipment.</p>
