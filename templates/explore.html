    <h1>Explore</h1>
    <p>Here the player explores the map, finding procedurally generated equipment and facing procedurally generated "Freelancers."</p>
    <p>Freelancers can be captured by GridLocking them: surrounding them on all 4 sides and surviving for a full turn cycle. In practice, this is best done by destroying the remaining mechs and targeting the lone survivor for capture and ultimate recruitment.</p>
