    <h1>Explore</h1>
    <p>Here the player explores the map, discovering other player bases, roving bands of Freelancers, and other suprises.</p>
    <p>The player can move as many teams as they have independently. Smaller teams allow for more coverage, but less strength in the event of a battle. Any battles that occur move to the Battles tab and movement is frozen until they're resolved.</p>
