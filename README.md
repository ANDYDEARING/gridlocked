# gridlocked

GridLocked is a single or multiplayer turn-based strategy game. The player interface is
separated into Battles, Workshop, and Explore.

<h1>Battles</h1>
    <p>Here the player manages their current battles. Battles are not timed and are paused by default, encouraging players to play here and there when they have time.</p>
    <h2>PvE</h2>
    <p>In a typical PvE battle, the player faces procedurally generated "Freelancers."</p>
    <p>Freelancers can be captured by GridLocking them: surrounding them on all 4 sides and keeping the surrounding mechs operational for a full turn cycle. In practice, this is best done by destroying the remaining mechs and targeting the lone survivor for capture and ultimate recruitment.</p>
    <p>Other than recruitment, players can find randomly generated equipment.</p>
    <h2>PvP</h2>
    <p>In a typical PvP battle, players take turns and are alerted via notification when it is their turn.</p>
    <p>PvP battles can either be Locked (where mechs are level balanced) or Open (where they carry their native stats).</p>
    <p>Ranked Battles will involve constructing teams in the workshop from a pool of mechs and equipment identical for all other players.</p>
    <p>Junkyard is also available with a common mech and equipment pool drafted by both players.</p>
    <p>Rewards will vary based on the format, but could include xp, fixed rewards, or keeping drafted mechs or equipment.</p>

<h1>Workshop</h1>
    <p>Here the player repairs, equips, and customizes their mechs.</p>
    <p>The player has a roster of fixed (but upgradeable) size and can organize their mechs into teams of up to 4 mechs each, adding (progessively more powerful) scripts so that the teams can act and react without the player being online.</p>
    <p>These teams can be deplyed to help the player's friends on raids or to defend key strong points. These teams will gain loot and xp while the player is not online and alert them with notifications here.</p>

<h1>Explore</h1>
    <p>Here the player explores the map, discovering other player bases, roving bands of Freelancers, and other suprises.</p>
    <p>The player can move as many teams as they have independently. Smaller teams allow for more coverage, but less strength in the event of a battle. Any battles that occur move to the Battles tab and movement is frozen until they're resolved.</p>
